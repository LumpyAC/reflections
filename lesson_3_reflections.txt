When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
using a remote repository is most efficient when working on a project from different machines or
mutiple people are working on the same project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
pulling changes manually allows the user to sync his commits only when he deems it necessary 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are clones made of a repository on the github servers - to be used when working on someone else's code or like a branch when working on your own
Clones are direct copies of a repository made from another repository or from a remote - to be used when starting work on someone else's code
Branches are copies of a repository that will implement new and/or experimental features - to be used when trying out new things
